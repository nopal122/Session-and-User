This is an example of login form using Session.
How it works : 
- User will start on "tampilanpermasalahan.html", in the first page user can log in or maybe sign up for the new user
- When user registered, their data will be stored on database(phpMyAdmin)
- If user have account already, they can just log in right away and they'll be moved to main.php
- When logging in, "login.php" will check the data first, does the data exist in database or not. If not, then user can't log in
